# Hey there!

It's awesome to see you here! Hope so you will enjoy going through my articles. 

This repository is basically devoted to my learning experience. Here I will be posting all the stuffs\(basically algorithms\) that I can lay my hands on.

## Talking about How frequently?

Well that I can't say. Depends on how frequently I learn one and also on my mood. Though I still have some idea, but better keep it to myself lest I break it like all my other resolutions!

## Why am I even writing these?

Yeah, I honestly understand your question. Why to write when there'll be hardly any readers?  
Well I'll agree with you to some extent but Hey, who cares! I'll anyway write tons and zillion of them and read it myself... So basically I am writing it for myself. And yeah, you're always welcome to read my blog...  
  
Shout out to all the great minds who inspired me to start my own blog! So stay tuned on my insights on Algorithms and Data Structure, who know you'll thank me some day! :D
